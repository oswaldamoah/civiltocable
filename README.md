# 📡 CivilToCable

A smart distance-based cable suggestion tool for fiber-optic deployment.

---

## 🧠 Problem

In planning fiber-optic connections, field engineers and planners often need to **manually determine the best preset cable lengths** to match ground-measured distances between connection points. This process is **time-consuming**, prone to **waste**, and **lacks optimization**—especially when combining multiple cable sizes.

---

## 💡 Solution

**CivilToCable** is a tool designed to **automate cable selection** based on distance inputs and available cable presets.

It offers:

* ✅ **Single and multiple cable solutions** to cover each ground distance efficiently
* 📥 **Text entry or file import** (CSV/XLSX) of preset cable lengths and measured distances
* 💾 **Persistent state with caching** (your data doesn't reset on page reload)
* 📱 **Installable as a PWA** (downloadable app on mobile and PC)
* ⚙️ **Modern UI** with a fullscreen hover-panel for streamlined input and filtering
* ⏱️ **Quick switching between datasets** and exporting your results
